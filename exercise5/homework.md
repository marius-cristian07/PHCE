## Exercise 4: Swap two numbers

**Goal:** Swap two variables inside a function.

Session 4 flipped a `bool` three ways. Now you swap two `int`s. The three ways are the
same.

### Instructions

1. Create a project `swap`. Copy in this program:

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>

   #include "pico/stdlib.h"

   void swap_by_value(int a, int b)  // gets copies
   {
       const int temp {a};
       a = b;
       b = temp;
   }

   void swap_by_pointer(int* a, int* b)  // gets addresses
   {
       // TODO 1: swap the two ints that a and b point at.
   }

   void swap_by_reference(int& a, int& b)  // gets other names
   {
       // TODO 2: swap a and b.
   }

   int main()
   {
       stdio_init_all();
       sleep_ms(2000);  // time to open the Serial Monitor

       int x {1};
       int y {2};
       std::cout << "start:        x = " << x << ", y = " << y << std::endl;

       swap_by_value(x, y);
       std::cout << "by value:     x = " << x << ", y = " << y << std::endl;

       swap_by_pointer(&x, &y);
       std::cout << "by pointer:   x = " << x << ", y = " << y << std::endl;

       swap_by_reference(x, y);
       std::cout << "by reference: x = " << x << ", y = " << y << std::endl;

       while (true)
       {
           sleep_ms(1000);
       }
   }
   ```
2. Fill in TODO 1. Copy the body of `swap_by_value()`. Put `*` before every `a` and `b`.
3. Fill in TODO 2. Copy the body of `swap_by_value()`. Change nothing.
4. Open the Serial Monitor. Then build and run. Fill in the table.

| Line | `x` | `y` |
|---|---|---|
| start | 1 | 2 |
| by value |1 |2 |
| by pointer | 2|1 |
| by reference |1 |2 |

### Checklist

- [x] TODO 1 and 2 filled in
- [x] Table filled in

**Why did `swap_by_value()` not swap?**

> _Answer: When passing parameters by value, the function receives independent copies of the original variables (a and b). The swap logic successfully swapped those local temporary copies inside the function's stack frame, but left the original x and y variables in main() untouched._
>

**The last line shows `x = 1` again. Why?**

> _Answer: Before swap_by_reference(x, y) was called, swap_by_pointer(&x, &y) had already swapped x and y in memory, making x = 2 and y = 1. Calling swap_by_reference(x, y) performed a second swap directly on the variables, returning x back to 1 (and y back to 2)._

## Exercise 5: A function that calls itself

**Goal:** Write a small recursive function.

A recursive function calls itself. Each call gets a smaller number. The base case says
when to stop.

### Instructions

1. Create a project `recursion`. Copy in this program:

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>

   #include "pico/stdlib.h"

   // Prints n, n - 1, ... 1, then "Liftoff!". Then each call says when it ends.
   void countdown(int n)
   {
       if (n == 0)  // the base case: stop here
       {
           std::cout << "Liftoff!" << std::endl;
           return;
       }
       std::cout << n << std::endl;
       countdown(n - 1);  // the function calls itself
       std::cout << "back in " << n << std::endl;
   }

   // Adds 1 + 2 + ... + n.
   int sum_to(int n)
   {
       // TODO 1: if n is 0, return 0.
       // TODO 2: else return n + sum_to(n - 1).
       return 0;
   }

   int main()
   {
       stdio_init_all();
       sleep_ms(2000);  // time to open the Serial Monitor

       countdown(5);
       std::cout << "sum_to(10) = " << sum_to(10) << std::endl;

       while (true)
       {
           sleep_ms(1000);
       }
   }
   ```
2. Open the Serial Monitor. Then build and run. Read `countdown()` and its output. Why do
   the `back in` lines count up?
3. Fill in TODO 1 and 2. You should see `sum_to(10) = 55`.
4. Define `factorial(int n)` like `sum_to()`. Use `*` instead of `+`. `factorial(0)` is 1.
5. Print `factorial(5)` in `main()`. You should see 120.
6. Delete the base case in `countdown()`. Build, run and watch. Then put it back and
   re-flash.

### Checklist

- [ ] `sum_to(10) = 55`
- [ ] `factorial(5) = 120`
- [ ] Step 6 tried, then fixed

**What does the base case in `sum_to()` do?**

> _Answer:_ The base case checks if n has reached 0 and returns 0 directly. This stops the function from calling itself endlessly, ending the recursion so the values on the stack can return and sum together.
>

**What happened in step 6? Why?**

> _Answer:_ The program printed continuously into negative numbers (0, -1, -2, ...) and then crashed or froze. Without a base case to stop execution, countdown() called itself endlessly until it ran out of stack RAM memory (causing a stack overflow).
